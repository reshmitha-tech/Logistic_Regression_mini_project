Logistic Regression — Breast Cancer Classification

📌 Overview

This mini project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.
The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on medical features.

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas

📊 Dataset

The project uses the Breast Cancer dataset available from Scikit-learn's built-in datasets module.
It contains diagnostic measurements computed from digitized images of breast mass samples.

⚙️ Workflow

1. Data loading
2. Feature and target separation
3. Model training using Logistic Regression
4. Prediction and accuracy evaluation

«Note: The model is trained on the full dataset without train-test splitting.
This project focuses on demonstrating the implementation of Logistic Regression.»

▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

3. Run the notebook or Python script

🎯 Result

The Logistic Regression model successfully classifies tumor types using the provided dataset features.
